How to use?
===========


You can import various resources from ``js.extjs`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page. The two basic resource sets that you'll
probably need are these ::

  >>> from js.extjs import extjs_basic, extjs_with_ux
  >>> extjs_basic.need()
  >>> extjs_with_ux.need()

You can also include individual resources:

  >>> from js.extjs import extjs_adapter_ext, extjs_js, extjs_css, extjs_ux, extjs_ux_js, extjs_ux_css
  >>> extjs_adapter_ext.need()
  >>> extjs_js.need()
  >>> extjs_css.need()
  >>> extjs_ux.need()
  >>> extjs_ux_js.need()
  >>> extjs_ux_css.need()

You can also import themes:

  >>> from js.extjs import extjs_theme_gray, extjs_theme_access
  >>> extjs_theme_gray.need()
  >>> extjs_theme_access.need()
